        <h3>"Recycling Made Easy"</h3>
            <div class="text"><p>Crumple is the answer to how to make recycling more practical and accessible. The app has the ability to assist users with finding their local recycle drop offs based on their current location. Crumple can help guide users with information on where they can drop off recyclables from plastic, metal, paper, and glass and other recyclables such as appliances. The app also has the ability to connect yourself with people in your local community to where you can compare your contributions to others. Crumple will be working with local grocery stores and gas stations in order to set up recycling stations at these locations.</p>

        <h1 id="context">Context & Challenges</h1>
             <div class="text"><p>How might we change the way that recycling is performed? How might we find ways to recycle efficiently without having to travel far? How might we make it easier and more convenient for people to recycle? These are questions that can be answered through the Crumple App.<br/>

            So how exactly do we fix this? Simple. Make recycling much more convenient by placing stations at local convenience stores and gas stations. The app will then guide the user to those locations.</p>

           <div class="text">
                <p>The largest issue that was presented when trying to create Crumple was figuring out how to balance a rewards feature. Originally there was a plan to create a financial reward system that would better motivate the users who use the app. However, through research and discovery interviews, it was determined that this feature would be a little more difficult to implement as originally thought.  For example, the goal of rewards is it is trying to incentivize  users to recycle, but there are many ways to implement such a system. The feedback that I received in relation to the rewards is that if included, would it positively or neutrally impact that way that users recycle?<br/></p>

            <div class="text">
               <p>In some areas, recycling is mandatory, however in other areas like Indianapolis this isn't the case. To fix this issue, the finalized goal was to allow more means of access by going to the grocery store or gas station to drop off your recyclables. For example, recycling rates have gone up in the last 50 years but they could definitely increase with the inclusion of more widespread and easily accessible locations to recycle.

            <p>I created three user personas based around the  5 discovery interviews that I scheduled about recycling and its benefits. So I combined multiple participants together for some of the user personas. <br/>
            When conducting walkthroughs of Crumple, these were some examples of the feedback that I originally received which I took into account for and decided to implement changes of my original designs.

                There are several different goals that a user has to complete in order to get the best user experience out of Crumple. The goal of the app is to have users start out in the map, then they will have the option to search for a location that is near them with the search option, after this the user will then find directions to their location of choice.

            </p>

            <p>
                Crumple is a map-based app, so the goal was in turn to make the user not have to jump through hoops to get to other aspects of the app, having it all on one page with the exception of Recycling/Group Leaderboard makes it more easy for a user to interact with. That being said, with this in mind, finishing up what the user wants to do through this page would be the connection that gets users to use Crumple. So to set up this connection, on the map page, there is an icon that is meant for the Recycling/Leaderboard page, the user is able to scan a receipt at their location of choice that will log those elements such as weight into Crumple.

                        From working on this project I learned that there is a wide variety of tools and concepts that you can use for making your own app. One of the most stressful aspects of designing your own app is finding out what works and what doesn't work and being able to find out what doesn't work through interaction with users, surveys, and peer feedback helped me push Crumple to succeed.
